#Description: we obtained the CEDEMSept2017final.zip elevation measurements and applied a simple spline function between the observations.
#We then filtered the result using a simple smoothing circular filter with a 3 m averaging window. 
#The resulting DEM output is shown in the thumbnail. 
#The RMSE between the measured values and the elevation model is 0.04 meters
